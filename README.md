# CarVets

## Description

CarVets is an app for finding car repair shops near the user's current location. It will pull up a map that displays the user's current location along with the 20 closest car repair shops. The user will then be able to select one of these locations and have a modal display basic information about the location including the location's name, address, rating, and a link to get directions. This site incorporates Google's javascript Map API, Place API, and Maps URL API.

## Installation

There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage

As the page starts up, the user's location will be pulled and a map will be generated with the 20 closest auto repair locations. The user will then be able to click on any of the marked locations to have an info window pop-up in the map with the location's name, address, average review, and a link to directions. If the user clicks on the link for the directions, they will be redirected to Google Maps and will be presented with a map with directions from their current location to the selected destination. If the user is on a mobile device with Google Maps installed and clicks on the link, they will automatically be moved from their web browser to the Google Maps app and with the directions loaded.
